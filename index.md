# Ethics Final Project!
#### Group Members: Bailey Klaus, Dain Kim, Sam Manfreda, Ashley Panousis, and Zoe Surma

### Introduction
This website aims to inform its users of different ethical frameworks and how someone might act when faced with different situations. In the videos below, we tackle the topic of a self-driving car’s decisions in various circumstances and decide whom or what is prioritized in each situation. More specifically, we examine six situations: prioritizing the young, the disadvantaged, the rules, the amount of lives saved, the passengers, and who is valued by society. With each scenario, we give an example of a circumstance these priorities would become relevant and explain what ethical frameworks would support the situation.

After the discussion on priorities, there is a fun and information quiz for you to complete. This will allow you to determine what ethical framework you might be!

After discovering what ethical framework you are, read our summary of the perspectives covered and take our engagement quiz to see how your ethical knowledge has improved.

### Self Driving Car Priorities

### Summary of Arguments
There are two options you could choose: saving the young people, or saving the old people. In this scenario, the utilitarian framework would consider prioritizing saving the young. The utilitarian framework focuses on maximizing the overall good and making decisions based on what might provide the most good for all people in the present and the future. In this situation, older people would provide less good in the future overall since they most likely will not be living as long as the younger people. 

In the scenario of saving the disadvantaged, an ethical framework that would be supporting this the most would be the feminist ethical framework. Feminists really emphasize caring for people. Their primary concerns are the potential effects on individuals and groups. In this situation, because the disadvantaged are the ones who need more care than the other ones, feminists would decide on prioritizing the disadvantaged. On the other hand, ethical frameworks such as utilitarian and deontological would be against prioritizing the disadvantaged in the self-driving car scenario. Utilitarians would be against saving the disadvantaged because they prioritize taking actions that will bring the best outcome for everyone, not taking care of people who are in need. Moreover, deontologists would also be against prioritizing the disadvantaged because they emphasize the universal laws which means always following the same set of rules no matter what consequences might follow. 

In the scenario where the rules are prioritized, someone might be acting with the legalist or deontological perspective in mind. These perspectives often consider abiding by universal laws as what is most important when making decisions. In this case, prioritizing the rules can be interpreted as abiding by a set of laws and is considered most important when deciding between actions.

In the scenario where the number of lives saved is prioritized, someone acting with the utilitarian perspective in mind is often considered. The utilitarian will often make their decision by considering the consequence of each action. Whichever action produces the most overall good will be taken. Someone with the utilitarian framework in mind would prioritize the number of lives saved because they might consider saving more lives leads to a greater overall good. This might be the case because more lives might lead to more contribution to the world.

In the scenario where those most valued by society are prioritized, one might be considered to be acting with the utilitarian perspective in mind. As the utilitarian acts to maximize overall good, prioritizing saving people who are considered “more important” or more valuable to society, who are likely to serve more good to society in the future if saved. When an individual is more valued by society can their life outway the lives of 2 or more other individuals? This is another factor that could be considered.

In the scenario where the passengers are prioritized above all else, one might be considering how the vehicle market operates. Vehicles are sold based on advertisements and the opinions of consumers. Prioritizing a vehicle’s buyer will lead to higher sales because consumers, at large, are more willing to buy things that will protect them and their family. So, the companies from a market perspective should meet these demands. Someone who prioritizes the passengers may be acting with the Feminist, Egoist, or Corporate Egosit framework in mind. Feminist ethics emphasizes that dependent relationships exists, particularly between a child and their caregiver. The caregiver is ethically obligated to protect the person dependent on them. With this in mind, the feminist ethicist might view the passengers as dependant on the safety of the vehicle; therefore, they might prioritize passengers. Someone thinking with an egoist perspective may also prioritize the passengers because the egoist believes there is no obligation to sacrifice themself for the sake of others. Finally, someone acting with a corporate egoist perspective might also prioritize passengers because they want the vehicle market to generate profit. By keeping passengers safe, the vehicle’s reputation is upheld.
