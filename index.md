# Ethics Final Project!

### Introduction
This website aims to inform its users of different ethical frameworks and how someone might act when faced with different situations. In the videos below, we tackle the topic of a self-driving carâ€™s decisions in various circumstances and decide whom or what is prioritized in each situation. More specifically, we examine six situations: prioritizing the young, the disadvantaged, the rules, the amount of lives saved, the passengers, and who is valued by society. With each scenario, we give an example of a circumstance these priorities would become relevant and explain what ethical frameworks would support the situation.

After the discussion on priorities, there is a fun and information quiz for you to complete. This will allow you to determine what ethical framework you might be!

After discovering what ethical framework you are, read our summary of the perspectives covered and take our engagement quiz to see how your ethical knowledge has improved.
